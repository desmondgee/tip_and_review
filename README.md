# Tip and Review App

An app designed for mobile to allow the user to quickly calculate tips using one of three methods:
1. A percentage based on the item subtotal.
2. A percentage based on the item subtotal and tax.
3. A manually entered tip amount.

The user then can create splits to see how much each friend needs to pay and has the option to generate a review and save it for future reference.

Future versions will feature a fully designed UI, improved ability to do analysis on past payments, and integeration with Google Maps and Yelp.
